If so who determines, how much?\r\n\r\nI ask this because if you are only going to have a small group contributing to the iteration, it may make more sense to make a closed/private branch for each iteration and incentivize the funders with a delayed release schedule, for example :\r\n\r\n$1,000 - constant access, participation in development process, immediate release.\r\n$100 - 2 weeks wait\r\n$10 - 4 weeks wait\r\nfree - 8 weeks wait\r\n\r\nTell me what you think and if you need help, I can contribute code."

There are a few cases,\r\nand I know a bunch of people who are really into bitcoins, but\r\nI don't know anyone who is making their living from selling things in bitcoins.\r\n\r\nWhat I don't see much of, is an actual bitcoin economy.\r\n\r\nBut what do the bitcoin community actually need to buy?\r\nthere is an electronics store with bitcoin, and apparently a street of resturants\r\nin berlin that all accept bitcoin.\r\n\r\nBut this is normal stuff. You can buy this stuff with a credit card easily enough.\r\nIf bitcoin is really to be successful, there needs to be a new kind of thing you  can buy with it, something that it's more suited for than regular money.\r\n\r\nSo, in a way, I am trying to test bitcoin here. Do the bitcoin community actually\r\nwant to have an economy and buy something? something that will make bitcoins actually more useful (and thus, valuable), or do they want to just sit on them and hope the price increases?\r\n\r\nSo, if you would use this if it wasn't with bitcoins, please explain your reasons."
